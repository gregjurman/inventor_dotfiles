Mustache template renderer (work in process)
--------------------------------------------

Lets you use a Mustache.js template to render setup sheets rather
than mucking with hard-coded javascript allowing for more flexability.

Uses/Features:

* Rendering responive setup sheets when using bootstrap or whatever.
* No need to mess with ```"html" + stuck + " in " + javascript.stupid['land']``` 

Place all files in the same Posts directory.

TODO:

* Add operations data to render context
* Add general property data to render context
* Generate image views when called for rather than always
